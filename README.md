# Minecraft Sword Generator

## Overview

This project aims to create a generative model capable of generating 16x swords for Minecraft. The diffusion model used was trained to produce unique and visually appealing sword designs.

The dataset was personally curated by collecting numerous diamond swords from various resource packs and resizing them to fit the desired dimensions.

I developed this project immediately after completing the Deeplearning.ai course on diffusion models. Much of the code is inspired by the examples used in their course.

## Code

The `imageTransformation.py` script was utilized for resizing the data.

To run the code, execute the notebook file `Training.ipynb`. It contains both the training process and a model test at the end.
